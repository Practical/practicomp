# Practical: Compiler
This is the repository for the compiler (LLVM based) for the Practical programming language.

# What is Practical?
Practical is a new programming language designed to give the safety and features one would expect from a modern programming
language without sacrificing speed in any way. Practical aims to be as fast, if not faster, than C.

Practical takes its inspiration for design and syntax from C++, Rust and D, while trying not to fall into any of the pitfalls
that those languages encountered.

Practical is aimed for programmers in the gaming, storage, video and, eventually, embedded markets, where high throughput and low
latency are everything.

# What's Planned?
For specifics on the plans for the language, syntax and features, please check out the
[language's wiki](https://github.com/Practical/practical-sa/wiki).
